Credits:

Several ideas on the code structure/layout for this application
were borrowed from Bloog <http://bloog.billkatz.com/>, which is
another GAE-based blog.

This application makes use of several 3rd party libraries.
The following libraries are included:

Markdown 2.0.1
Pygments 1.0
Dateutil 1.4.1
PyRSS2Gen 1.0.0
BlueprintCSS 0.9

Building this blog was much easier because of the authors of
those libraries.  Thanks!
